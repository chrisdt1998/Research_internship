# **Investigating the Explainability Power of Transformers in the Video Domain**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the code associated with the research internship that I did at Maastricht University. The main
goal of this project was to adapt different visual techniques to the video domain to be used by the TimeSformer, where
the TimeSformer is a transformer based model for video classification.

For more information, please read the report labelled "Research_Internship_report.pdf" in the repository.
